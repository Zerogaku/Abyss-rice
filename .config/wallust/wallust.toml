# How the image is parse, in order to get the colors:
#  * full    - reads the whole image (more precision, slower)
#  * resized - resizes the image to 1/4th of the original, before parsing it (more color mixing, faster)
#  * thumb   - fast algo hardcoded to 512x512 (faster than resized)
#  * wal     - uses image magick `convert` to read the image (less colors)
backend = "resized"

# What color space to use to produce and select the most prominent colors:
#  * lab      - use CIEL*a*b color space
#  * labmixed - variant of lab that mixes colors, if not enough colors it fallbacks to usual lab,
# for that reason is not recommended in small images
color_space = "labmixed"

# Difference between similar colors, used by the colorspace:
#  1          Not perceptible by human eyes.
#  1 - 2      Perceptible through close observation.
#  2 - 10     Perceptible at a glance.
#  11 - 49    Colors are more similar than opposite
#  100        Colors are exact opposite
threshold = 15

# Use the most prominent colors in a way that makes sense, a scheme:
#  * dark      - 8 dark colors, color0 darkest - color7 lightest, dark background light contrast
#  * dark16    - same as dark but it displays 16 colors
#  * harddark  - same as dark but with darker hard hue colors
#  * light     - 8 light colors, color0 lightest - color7 darkest, light background dark contrast
#  * light16   - same as light but displays 16 colors
#  * softlight - counterpart of `harddark`
